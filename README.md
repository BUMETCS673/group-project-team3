# This is the repo for the StockGetter app developed by the Group 3 Team
### The project will be a web-based application called StockGetter. The idea behind the app is to allow an end user to obtain history of stock price and volume data (i.e. time series data for stock prices and volumes) for publicly traded stocks in the US as well as provide a forecast of the said prices and volumes using a modern machine learning algorithm. 

## The objectives and priorities for the project are:
### forecasting stock prices, plotting multiple stocks in one graph, and downloading stock data to local machines. The goals of the project are completing the proposed essential features, as well as developing some optional features if time permits, which including a log-in page, multiple plots for different sets of stocks, printing capability, and deployment.
