# group-project-team3
The project will be a web-based application called StockGetter. The idea behind the app is to allow an end user to obtain history of stock price and volume data (i.e. time series data for stock prices and volumes) for publicly traded stocks in the US as well as provide a forecast of the said prices and volumes using a modern machine learning algorithm. 

This is the repo for the StockGetter app developed by the Group 3 Team
The team includes the following memebres:
* Duy Nguyen
* Jing Tian
* Serguei Chervachidze
* Sylvie Xiang
