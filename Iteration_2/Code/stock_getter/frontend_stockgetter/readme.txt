Readme for StockGetter Site:

****************************************
To make the site work properly, please launch index in localhost. 
This is needed due to CORS restricitons when using modules, and this will not 
work properly when opening index as a file.

For example you can use Python HTTP Server module:
1. open the same folder as the intex.html file in the terminal
2. on command line run the following: python -m http.server (this will open a
 basic web server and will serve the index page)
3. open the page on local host by going to the following URL:
     http://localhost:8000/

You can serve this via a different port (see documentation for the HTTP Server
module), or use any other web server.
