Sylvie's self introduction:

Hi all, 

My name is Sylvie and I am doing the CSDA program. It is so fascinating knowing that people in the class are from various backgrounds. 
I am very impressed by the experience you have in the field of computer science. 
I was previously majoring in econometrics and mathematics. 
I had my academic and professional trainings in various topics including environmental economics, public pension policies, and business reputation. 
During my study at BU, I am definitely gaining a lot more knowledge in computer science and machine learning and feel that I am improving my skills as well. 
I am familiar with R, STATA, Python, Java, Weka, and JMP. 
I am looking forward to learning more from this course and from all of you,

Duy's self-introduction:

Hello everyone,

My name is Duy Nguyen, working as a Quality Manager (manufacturing not software) at Carrier. I have a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering but while working as a Quality Manager, I noticed the importance of software, automation and data analysis. I decided to get a master in Compsci (no concentration) in order to further automate and improve my current job or perhaps get into the data science field. 
Looking forward to meeting, working and learning a lot from everyone. 

Duy Nguyen
