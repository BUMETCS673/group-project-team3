Hi all, 

My name is Sylvie and I am doing the CSDA program. It is so fascinating knowing that people in the class are from various backgrounds. 
I am very impressed by the experience you have in the field of computer science. 
I was previously majoring in econometrics and mathematics. 
I had my academic and professional trainings in various topics including environmental economics, public pension policies, and business reputation. 
During my study at BU, I am definitely gaining a lot more knowledge in computer science and machine learning and feel that I am improving my skills as well. 
I am familiar with R, STATA, Python, Java, Weka, and JMP. 
I am looking forward to learning more from this course and from all of you,
